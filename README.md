# CRMLead Dispo
This is a Ruby application that will get statuses of leads from an EspoCRM database with custom field "call_dispo", format them into a CSV file, and email them using an Office 365 account.

This uses a config.yml file so that you can place your environment specifics there. A sample_config.yml file is provided for you to use as template.
